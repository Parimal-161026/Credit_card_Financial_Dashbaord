Power Bi Dashboard which gives us insights about the transactions and Customers Credit card expenditure Data.
I'd like to walk you through a credit card dashboard I designed in Power BI, which provides strategic insights into customer demographics, transaction behaviors, and card performance.

Starting with customer demographics, I observed that the largest user segment is aged 30–40, followed closely by the 40–50 group. This reflects a financially active and mature customer base. Additionally, there is a nearly balanced gender ratio and a strong representation of graduates and postgraduates, which indicates a well-educated audience — ideal for targeting with premium financial products.

Geographically, the top states like California, Texas, and New York have the highest cardholder volumes, which helps prioritize regional marketing strategies.

From an occupational standpoint, businessmen and white-collar professionals generate the highest revenue and interest income. This shows a clear opportunity for upselling Gold and Platinum cards to these high-value users.

In terms of card usage, the Blue card has the highest adoption and transaction volume, which is great for overall engagement but also highlights a gap in premium card utilization. This insight supports a recommendation to repackage or better promote higher-tier cards.

On the spending side, most transactions are focused on bills, entertainment, and fuel, suggesting that the card is primarily used for essential and lifestyle expenses. I also found that swipe-based transactions dominate, while online payments are underutilized — an area where digital adoption strategies can drive growth.

Quarterly trends show consistent revenue and transaction counts across all four quarters, with a slight upward trend, indicating healthy customer engagement and stability.

Overall, this dashboard enables the business to identify upsell opportunities, digital payment gaps, and target segments for personalized campaigns. It transforms raw data into actionable insights that can guide marketing, product design, and customer engagement."
